**Overview**

We participated in a fun and engaging hackathon at North Dakota State University (NDSU). It was an incredible experience filled with creativity, collaboration, and innovation. We worked together to develop a project that showcases our skills and teamwork.This project aims to predict agricultural yield using machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and modeling with deep neural networks (DNN) and random forests (RF). Our work showcases our collaboration during the hackathon at NDSU.
